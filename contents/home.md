#### News
**<span style="color:red;">I am actively looking for Research Intern / Assistant opportunities</span>**,  
aligned with **Agentic AI** and **tool-augmented LLMs**, **Reinforcement Learning** for multi-step or long-horizon models, and **multimodal reasoning**.

I am especially excited about directions such as **foundation agent training** and **tool-augmented agent system**,  
where my recent experience on **multimodal RAG** and **benchmarking design** can contribute immediately.

#### Biography
Hi! I am currently a master's student in the Department of Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley.  
I am really fascinated by Reinforcement Learning and agents recently, and I wish I could gain a deeper insight into this area.

#### Education
M.E., Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, 2024—2025.\
B.S., Civil Engineering, Zhejiang University (China), 2020—2024.

#### Research Interests
I am passionate about **Reinforcement Learning**, **Agentic AI Systems**, **multimodal reasoning**, and **benchmark evaluation**.

1. **RL & Agent**
   - Multi-turn reasoning tasks: treat them as multi-turn MDPs, design appropriate rewards and train accordingly.  
   - Tool-augmented agent system: multi-agent collaboration and efficient tool utilization.

2. **LLM Application**
   - Multimodal RAG: multimodal retrieval systems with multiple objectives.  
   - Benchmark: design and construct evaluation datasets that reflect core improvements in papers.

#### Why I want to pursue LLM rather than traditional Statistics or Civil Engineering

I believe the future belongs to AI. There are many unexplored areas in LLM research, so I want to contribute by exploring **reinforcement**, **reasoning**, and **tool-use** aspects. At last, I am going to apply what I have learned to the real world application.  

I also enjoy domains that evolve rapidly. Each new tech or method excites me to **learn** and **innovate**. I love learning new knowledge. 

My background in **engineering** and **statistics** strengthens my ability to combine  
experimental intuition with theoretical understanding. From my perspective, LLMs rely heavily on **trial and error**, they needs lots of experimentation and sometimes we may not fully understand why they works, it is an engineering mindset. At the same time, mathematical and statistical theories can explain models, which guide us a deeper understanding of why they succeed, where they fail, and how to systematically improve them.

This combination of practical intuition and theoretical grounding is what excites me most about pursuing research in this field.
