#### News
I am actively looking for Research Intern / Asistant opportunity, aligned with Agentic AI and tool-augmented LLMs, Reinforcement Learning for multi-step or long-horizon models, and multimodel reasoning.
I am especially excited about directions such as foundation agent training and tool-augmented agent system, where my recent experience on multimodel RAG and benchmarking design can contribute immediately.

#### Biography
Hi! I am currently a master's student in the Department of Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. I am really fascinated by Reinforcement Learning and agents recently, and I wish I could gain a deeper insight into this area. 

#### Education
M.E., Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, 2024—2025.\
B.S., Civil Engineering, Zhejiang University (China), 2020—2024.

#### Research Interests
I am passionate about Reinforcement Learning, Agentic AI System, multimodel reasoning as well as benchmark evaluation.
1. RL & Agent
    Multi-turn reasoning tasks: Treat them as multi-turn MDPs, design appropriate rewards and train accordingly. 
    Tool-augmented agent system: Multi-agent collaboration and how to efficiently use different tools.
2. LLM Application
    Multimodel RAG: multimodel retrieval system with multiple objectives.
    Benchmark: Design and contruct evaluation datasets that reflect the core improvements proposed in the paper.

#### Why I want to pursue LLM rather than traditional Statistics or Civil Engineering
Firstly, I believe the future is a world dominated by AI. There are still many areas that remain unexplored. So I want to catch up on the development of LLM and do some research on it, and at last apply what I have learned in the real-world application.

Secondly, I love domains that update rapidly. In the area of LLM, I feel really excited and astonished to see what new tech or idea is proposed, and I can learn from it and make innovations by myself. I love learning new knowledge.

Thirdly, I have a strong background in engineering and statistical knowledge. I think these two are critical to LLM learning as well as research. This is because LLM or deep learning is based on trail and error, it needs experimentation, sometimes you don't know why it is better, it is a mindset of an engineer. In addition, statistic background help me better understand what is behind some phenomenon, and understand these things deeply.
